# Arthaniti
Hi, I’m **Subham Bairagi**, the leader of Team **ByteForce**. I am presenting Project *Arthaniti* to you.🦥📰

The idea for *Arthaniti* didn’t come from reading papers or market reports. It came from everyday observation. Around us—housemaids, drivers, delivery workers, security guards—people deal with money daily, yet most financial platforms completely ignore how they think, read, and learn. Finance is usually explained in **English**, wrapped in **heavy terms**, and delivered in a way that feels **intimidating rather than helpful.**

I wanted to build something that respects this audience. Something that doesn’t assume fluency, confidence, or prior knowledge. Just clarity.

*Arthaniti* works in a very simple way. Financial concepts are explained in **Bengali**, broken down into **small, focused chapters.** Each chapter is followed by a **short quiz session** — not to test users, but to help them notice what they just read. If someone selects a wrong answer, the platform doesn’t shame them. Instead, it quietly takes them back to the same chapter and highlights the exact line from where the answer came. The idea is simple: **learning should guide, not punish.** On the other hand, each small quiz win is rewarded with mini-celebrations to keep the user motivated and provide them with the necessary fuel to keep moving forward.💪🏽

When users feel stuck—or when the chapter and quiz content is no longer enough—they can talk to *Kaka Babu*, our AI-powered chatbot. Kaka Babu speaks in **conversational Bengali** and behaves more like a **helpful elder** 🧓🏽🕶, than a machine. He’s there to clear doubts, explain things again in simpler words, and support users once the core learning material is exhausted.

Building this wasn’t a solo journey. **Debam Das**, my close ally and a core ByteForce member, worked with me through peer programming and helped turn this idea into a functioning platform. From structuring the system to solving technical challenges, his contribution was crucial in making *Arthaniti* real.

I’d also like to give special thanks to **Sayan Das** and **Sandipan Majumdar**, fellow ByteForce members, for supporting us in meaningful ways throughout the project.

*Arthaniti* is not about showing off technology. It’s about using technology quietly, responsibly, and respectfully—so learning finance finally **feels approachable** to the **people who need it the most.**
